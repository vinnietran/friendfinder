# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a simulated networking site that can help the user find friends. The user responds to questions to a series of questions with an answer of 1-5, based on how much the user agrees with the statement. The responses are then compared against the responses of other users. Based on these answers, a calculation is done, and the user is shown their best match.

## Technologies Used 

This app leverages Node.js and Express.js to run the backend. On the front end, I incorporated both Bootstrap and Materialize elements, along with the use of JQuery.
